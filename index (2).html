        <h2>The Experiment</h2>
        <p>Newton conducted thought experiments and observed the motion of celestial bodies. He formulated the law of universal gravitation, which states that every mass attracts every other mass in the universe with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.</p>
